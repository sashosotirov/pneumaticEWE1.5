This is an Arduino library that provides support for multiple digital
buttons on a single analog input pin.  The buttons are arranged along
a resistor ladder, which causes each button press to yield a different
voltage at the input pin.

The library automatically debounces the buttons and optionally
emulates repeating keypresses.

To obtain the most recent version of the code or to report issues (or,
better, provide fixes), please visit the Github pages at

Inquiries via the Github issue tracker, please.  This way, others may benefit
from the answers.
